// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BOUNTY BOARD — generated, player-selected quest POSTINGS on a beat
// (docs/design/bounty-board.md, M0 "the board stands").
//
// A POSTING is a small persisted instance (kind row id + claimed target +
// pay + provenance) minted by the board at its beat's seeded arm; ACCEPTING
// one derives an ordinary QuestDef (postingQuestDef — the quest fabric's own
// header: "Bounty boards are the same primitive with a different giver") so
// the journal, map markers, field-clear hook and payout site all serve it
// through World.questDefOf. Pay resolves at THE TURN-IN back at the board
// (walk-1's collect ruling — the QuestTurnIn withhold lane is the default).
//
// KINDS are an open registry (registerBountyKind — the puzzle-kinds idiom):
// each row rolls its own target off the live world through the seat fabric,
// answers done()/failed()/annulled() as pure READS (the predicate is the
// law; hooks are UX), and speaks its card copy in the precision register.
// M0 ships ONE kind — THE CHARGE ("complete the objective of the place");
// the M1 spread (errand/cull) and M2's live-census answers join as rows.
//
// THE PER-BOARD LAW (walk 1, unhardcoded by ruling): every posting records
// its issuing boardId and the one-hand cap FOLDS per board — today's single
// Lastlight board collapses the fold to the global cap of 1, and regional
// boards (the writ kinship, post-M4) become a dial's turn, never a rewrite.
