# The Vertical Fabrics — collapse, traversal, understory

`src/engine/collapse.ts` (dissolving ground) · `src/engine/traversal.ts` +
`src/data/traversals.ts` (vertical crossings) · `src/render/vis/understory.ts`
(the world far below) — the three fabrics the ASCENT rides, each generic on
its own.

The Aetherial's cloud shelf is the reference composition: a geyser LAUNCHES
you (traversal) onto a lattice hung over the very zone you left, whose gaps
look DOWN on that land (understory through `window` region cells) and whose
ground DOES NOT LAST (collapse). Fall, and the land below catches you where
you dropped (traversal again, inverted). Any future rotting bridge-town,
cracking ice sheet, or dive-into-the-maelstrom reuses the same three seams.

## The collapse fabric

A zone whose **theme carries a `CollapseSpec`** is built on dissolving
ground. Needs a grid layout (`GridWalkField`); convex zones decline.

| Field | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| `region` | region kind melted cells become (`cloud_void` — a `window` visual) |
| `melts` | which walkable kinds can melt (default `['ground']` — roads, air pockets, structure floors stand) |
| `crumble` | seconds a cell visibly shivers/cracks before voiding |
| `contact` | `{ delay, radius?, warmup? }` — footfalls arm the floor; it follows you down |
| `ambient` | `{ start, band, jitter, holdout, sweep, halo? }` — the seeded rim-inward wavefront + the spine's own late, entry-first erosion |
| `fall` | `{ kind: 'below'\|'eject', damageFrac?, grace?, grasp? }` — what losing the floor MEANS |
| `goal` | `{ doodad? }` — the never-melting platform the spine runs to (else the farthest exit) |
| `goalClear` / `entryClear` / `entryGrace` | protected radii (defaults in `COLLAPSE_CFG`) |
| `armMove` | MOVEMENT ARMING distance (default `COLLAPSE_CFG.armMoveDist`, `0` = armed at build) — see below |

**THE GUARANTEE.** The schedule is computed outward-in over the
distance-to-spine field (BFS from the entry→goal walk); the spine erodes on
its own later clock, entry-first, and the goal platform NEVER melts — so a
runner who keeps pace always has standing ground ahead, all the way to the
exit. Dawdle and the causeway crumbles under your heels. Generation owns the
other half of the promise: the `aether_lattice` recipe pushes the gate into
`ctx.mustReach`, so the reachability invariant (and genqa) prove the path the
collapse erodes.

- **MOVEMENT ARMING (the grace period)** — the dissolution cannot begin until
  a player has actually MOVED: the field holds its `clock` at zero (every
  schedule quantity is clock-relative, so the whole choreography — ambient
  wave, contact warmup, entry grace — waits as one) until a WAKE body (the
  player party, passed by the World; monsters never wake it) steps
  `armMove` world units (default `COLLAPSE_CFG.armMoveDist`) from where it
  stood when the field went up. A player reading their inventory on arrival
  melts nothing; re-entry rebuilds the field and re-graces it. The fall test
  still runs pre-arm — pre-existing void keeps its teeth. `armMove: 0` opts a
  spec back into arming at build.
- **LEDGE GRASP (the fall predicate)** — a body is SUPPORTED while any part
  of its grasp disc (`radius × (fall.grasp ?? WALK_CFG.ledgeGrasp)`) still
  overlaps something that holds it — walkable ground or blocking mass,
  anything but open void (`GridWalkField.supportedAt`). Touching a lip is a
  grasp, like catching a cliff edge; only a body WHOLLY past all support runs
  the coyote clock (teeter) or trips the boundary skyfall door. The swept
  confine honors the same rule: a move may carry the center past the lip
  while the body still overlaps standing cloud, so walking off is a
  deliberate, continued act — brushing the edge never drops you. `grasp: 0`
  restores the old center-point precision. One knob, every vertical fabric:
  collapse teeter, flux teeter, and the movement boundary door all read it.
- **Seed discipline** — the schedule rolls on `zoneSeed ^ COLLAPSE_CFG.salt`
  with a dedicated Rng; it never advances layout/spawn rng (the fog contract).
- **Transience** — state rebuilds fresh each loadZone; leave and return and
  the ground has re-knit (the worldstate movers doctrine — the dream re-forms).
- **The grid is the truth** — melting goes ONLY through
  `GridWalkField.fillRegion`, so the grid's own version/dirty machinery
  re-bakes floor chunks (budgeted) and re-flows pathing; clampPos/castRay read
  live. No collapse-specific invalidation exists anywhere.
- **Who falls** — the field reports; the World routes. Fliers/levitators are
  immune (`a.flying || a.levitates`), mid-leap/mid-dash bodies are skipped
  (dash out of a crumbling cell!), the player gets the coyote `fall.grace`
  then the sky-fall crossing, ally seats snap to standing ground, and
  everything else is simply KEPT by the sky — no corpse, no loot, no credit.
- **Where you land — THE NETHER TIE** (`DimensionDef.over`): a realm that
  hangs over another shares its map-coordinate space, and every zone in it
  resolves the nearest charted zone of the world below at its own coordinate
  (`World.skyBelow`, per loadZone; authored `ZoneDef.below` anchors outrank
  it). Every fall truly DROPS (`fall.kind: 'below'`): anchored shelves land
  1:1 through the shelf's center; over-tied zones land at the PROPORTIONAL
  spot — where you stood above is where you come down, on the very terrain
  the windows showed. `'eject'` remains the data option. THE EDGE IS A DOOR
  (`boundaryPolicy: 'skyfall'` on the cloud voids): the floor leaving you is
  one fall, and STEPPING OFF is the other — walk past a gap's edge and the
  world below catches you the same way. No confinement lip, and no hard-lock:
  a runner stranded on a melted-out island always has one deliberate step
  down. Wings, levitation and airborne moves (dash/leap) never trigger it.
- **Selective ground** (`melts`) — the High Spires pattern: register a
  second walkable cloud (`cloud_frail`, a shimmering dusk wash — the visual
  IS the warning) and name it alone in `melts`. Courts, decks and portals
  stay `ground` and never arm; contact-only specs (no `ambient`) make the
  frailty purely trafficked — a fight held on a frail span drops the span.
- Runtime: `World.collapse: CollapseField | null`, built at the loadZone tail,
  ticked in `updateCollapse` beside fog/heat. Renderer wobble/crack overlay =
  `drawCollapseOverlay` reading `field.active` + `crumbleFrac(i)` (ablate pass
  `'collapse'`, knobs `VIS_CFG.collapseFx`).

## The traversal fabric

A **registered vertical crossing** (`registerTraversal` — rows in
`data/traversals.ts`: `sky_launch`, `sky_fall`): windup → rise (veil closes;
the ZONE SWAP fires at its end, hidden) → land (veil clears). The player is
pinned, skill-locked (`useLock`), untargetable + invulnerable; every dwell in
the game holds its breath (`!this.traversal` guards). The renderer draws the
pose (scale/lift/spin over a pinned, thinning shadow — `traversalPose`), the
wind streaks, and the whiteout veil (`traversalVeil`, covers the HUD by
design).

`World.beginTraversal(id, { swap, done, capture })` is the one entry.
`SidezoneDef.traversal: '<id>'` makes any mouth a crossing (the geyser); the
mint is split (`mintSidezone`) so the pocket def exists BEFORE the veil —
its `below` sizes the understory capture request.

## The understory

**What shows through `window` region cells** (`RegionVisualSpec.window` — the
ground baker CLEARS those cells instead of filling; the `edge` rim still
bakes, so every gap wears a torn cloud-lip). Drawn each frame under the
ground chunks (`drawFloor`), camera-center parallax so the land slides
against the shelf:

- **Captured mode** — during a launch windup the renderer snapshots the
  DEPARTURE zone (floor + coarse mottle + region cells + doodad silhouettes,
  clipped to the land's true bounds, altitude haze + desaturation baked) into
  an LRU keyed by the destination id (`TraversalCapture`). One-time cost,
  hidden under the cinematic.
- **Headless mode** — no live capture around (dev jump, re-entered shelf,
  any over-tied realm zone): the below zone's layout mints deterministically
  from its own def (`generateLayout`, portal pixels from the placeExit math)
  and paints the same aerial. Anchored shelves get their 1:1 window;
  over-tied zones get the WHOLE resolved surface zone STRETCHED beneath them
  — the stretch the proportional fall agrees with. Field/boundless zones
  decline honestly.
- **Cloud-sea mode** (`ZoneTheme.understory: 'cloudsea'`) — the endless
  procedural deck; the last-resort fallback. Drifting cloud shadows cross
  everything.
- `ZoneDef.below: { zoneId, ax, ay }` is the shared anchor: the shelf's
  center hangs over `(ax, ay)`, so falls map 1:1 and the capture window
  frames the same ground the holes reveal. Pure data; serializes verbatim.

## The Ascent composition (the reference rider)

`sky_geyser` mouths roll per eligible open-sky zone
(`World.placeAscentGeyser`, seeded per zone, gated + ignition-scaled through
`sim.ascentField` — packages/defs/ascent.ts holds every number). The shelf
mints from the `aether` tileset (variant faces per mouth), plays as ESCAPE,
and its far end raises the `ascendant_gate` — a **`DimensionEntry.gateDoodad`**
realm gate: the dwell loop scans every registered dimension's gate doodad
(data, never a kind literal) and `enterDimension('aetherial')` mints The
Firmament. Hell is delved into; heaven must be survived into.

## Extension seams

- A new dissolving biome = a `CollapseSpec` on any grid-layout theme (variants
  override wholesale — the aether's three faces run three tempos).
- A new crossing = one `registerTraversal` row + a `beginTraversal` call (or a
  `SidezoneDef.traversal` tag).
- A new realm gate = `DimensionEntry.gateDoodad` on a dimension row.
- A new below-view = set `ZoneDef.below` at mint (captured) or
  `theme.understory` (procedural).
