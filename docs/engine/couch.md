# THE COUCH FABRIC — local shared-screen co-op

`src/data/couch.ts` (COUCH_CFG + CouchSeatTag) · `src/net/couch.ts` (PadSeatInput,
PadClaimScanner) · `src/ui/couchJoin.ts` (the join overlay) · seams in
`engine/world.ts`, `render/camera.ts`, `render/renderer.ts`, `ui/panels.ts`,
`core/gamepad.ts`, `meta/character.ts`, `main.ts` · probe
`balance/probe_couch.ts`.

A second player on the same machine — Diablo-couch style: one screen, two
controllers, two characters. The design is a COMPOSITION, not a mode: a couch
guest is an ordinary engine `Seat` whose intent comes from a second physical
pad and whose UI docks to its own screen flank. Every hard multiplayer problem
(intent application, XP share, loot rights, downed/revive, enemy scaling, zone
travel) was already solved by the host-authoritative seat fabric and is reused
verbatim — the couch adds a device, a frame, and a flank.

## THE SOLO INVARIANT (the first law)

With no couch seats, every branch short-circuits: no state, no draw, no clamp,
no menu row, no claim listener. `Seat.couch` is absent on every non-guest seat
and its absence IS the check (`World.couchActive()`); the renderer's
`couchStretch` pins to exactly 1 (`zoom` reads the byte-identical classic
1.3), `world.couchConfine` stays null, the HUD draws the one centered classic
cluster, and the pause menu carries no couch row until ≥ `join.minPads`
controllers are CONNECTED. Verified three ways: the probe's solo block, the
sim baseline gate (no gated metric moved), and the live rig.

## The seats

- `Seat.couch?: CouchSeatTag` — `{ pad, side, charId?, rosterSlot? }`. The tag
  is the whole identity: which physical pad drives it, which flank its UI
  claims, and (immortal lane) which roster vessel it persists as.
- Accessors: `couchSeats()`, `couchActive()`, `couchHeroes()` (the controlled
  bodies the frame must hold — the possession pointer, like solo),
  `localHumanSeats()` (local hero first — station dwells scan in this order so
  solo is order-identical), `accountSeat(seat)` (local OR couch: both
  characters belong to the one account on the couch), `seatModeDef/seatStageDef`.
- Guest seat ids are `c1`, `c2`… (`main.ts couchSeatSerial`) — never colliding
  with net peers (`p…`) or mercs (`m…`).

## Input — one pad per player

- `core/gamepad.ts`: `readPadSource(index?, exclude?)` binds a `PadState` to
  ONE pad slot (`PadState.padIndex`) or runs the classic ROAM — the
  freshest-`timestamp` connected pad wins — SKIPPING claimed slots
  (`PadState.padExclude`: the hero's read can never be steered by a guest's
  pad). `PadState.sourceIndex` records the slot the last poll read.
  `connectedPadIndices()` + `padButtonDown()` + `padIdAt()` serve the join
  census and the identity law; `window.__fakePads[]` is the indexed test rig
  beside the legacy `__fakePad` — fakes may carry `timestamp` + `id` to get
  HARDWARE semantics (timestamp-less fakes keep first-slot-wins, which every
  older probe was written against).
- **THE CLAIM PIN** (`PadState.padPin` + `net/couch.ts CouchClaimSession`):
  while the join overlay's claim scan is armed, the hero's roaming read is
  FROZEN where it stood at overlay open — its recently-active slot (judged
  on the pad's OWN poll clock, `activeAtLastPoll`), else no pad at all.
  Without the pin the joining pad's very first Ⓐ press became "the hero's
  pad" in that same frame and the scan (excluding the hero's live pad) could
  never see it — the claim was structurally impossible on real hardware (the
  Steam Deck report; timestamp-less fakes hid it from the rig). The pin
  LIFTS at the claim so the claimed pad may drive the pick pointer, and the
  claiming press itself is one-shot SWALLOWED (`suppressNextEdge`) so the
  roam's mid-hold adoption can't mint a stray click into the pick overlay.
- **THE IDENTITY RE-BIND** (`CouchGuestCtx.padId` + `findRebindSlot` + the
  per-frame `couchGuestPadSweep`): a claimed pad that vanishes (Bluetooth
  sleep, Steam Input device churn) releases its slot back to the hero's pool
  and PARKS the seat — `Renderer.couchPadLost` says so on the guest's flank
  ("CONTROLLER DISCONNECTED") — and a pad wearing the SAME device id
  re-binds the seat automatically, but only at a NEWCOMER slot (one that was
  not connected when the loss was noticed): a standing pad, the hero's idle
  one included, can never be stolen, even by an identical twin (the Gamepad
  API exposes no serials; the newcomer rule is the honest disambiguator).
  A stranger pad appearing while a seat is parked joins the HERO's roam,
  never the seat.
- `net/couch.ts PadSeatInput` mirrors `readLocalInput`'s pad half exactly —
  analog move fold, deflection-scaled world-space aim, the soft assist with
  sticky write-back, the dt≤0 twin guard, held/edge/meta slot grammar, the
  unarmed-floor opt-out — so a guest's hands feel byte-for-byte like the
  hero's pad. Device polling stays in main.ts's tick (same wall clock).
- The guest's reticle draws in its class tint (`Renderer.couchAims`), fed per
  frame from `PadSeatInput.aimView()` — drawn IS what their casts receive.

## THE COUCH FRAME + THE EDGE LAW (render/camera.ts)

- `couchFit(eyes, screenW, screenH, baseZoom, spec)` — pure: focus = the
  heroes' bbox center; `stretch` (≤1) fits bbox + 2×`fitMarginWu` on screen,
  floored at `maxStretch`. One hero degenerates to the solo frame exactly.
- The renderer smooths `couchStretch` toward the fit (`zoomLerp`), feeds the
  focus through the UNCHANGED `placeCamera` mode registry, then publishes
  `world.couchConfine = couchConfineRect(cam, vw, vh, spec)` — the drawn frame
  inset by `confineMarginWu`. Drawn == confined by construction.
- `World.applyCouchConfine()` runs dead last among movers (after the
  grab/cling/possession slave steps): local heroes clamp into the published
  rect whatever moved them; a body honestly HELD (`Actor.heldBy`) is exempt
  (its seat wins the frame); enemies are never touched. `loadZone` nulls the
  rect (a frame never crosses a zone seam); a DEGENERATE viewport (<64px —
  minimized window) publishes no rect and holds the stretch (the rig caught
  the 1×1 point-prison this guards against).
- Feel: heroes close = solo zoom; walking apart breathes the frame out to the
  cap (live rig: 1 → 0.72 exactly); at the cap both pin at the frame's edge
  and further stick pour moves NO ONE — you keep running, the world stops
  giving.

## UI — flanks, lenses, and the latch

- HUD (canvas): `drawHud` dispatches per seat — solo keeps the one centered
  cluster byte-identically; couch anchors each seat's whole cluster (orbs,
  arcs, bar, pips, buffs, grammar rows, possession chip, XP) to its flank
  (`COUCH_CFG.join.sides`, hud.sideInset), guest bars read PAD glyphs, guest
  identity docks to its top corner. World-level lines (zone banner, wave
  banner, boss bar) draw once.
- Panels (DOM): THE COUCH LENS — per-player panels remember their OPENER
  (`UI.panelSeatIds`); the refresh renders that seat's data and the panel
  docks to its flank (`couch-left`/`couch-right`, injected styles,
  `panels.sideWidthFrac`). Different panels open simultaneously per player;
  the SAME panel contended = the latest opener takes ownership (visible,
  predictable; a twin-instance lane is queued). The world map stays ONE
  shared chart (it always was).
- Mutations: THE ACTION LATCH — capture-phase listeners stamp
  `world.uiActionSeatId` for the duration of any dispatch inside a
  guest-owned panel (drag gestures keep their owner through the drop), and
  `requestMeta` routes to that seat via the existing seat-scoped
  `applyAction`. Zero per-call-site edits; null between dispatches so the
  frame loop can never misroute.
- Escape: seat-scoped cascades (`escCascadeFor(seatId)`) — each player's
  cancel walks THEIR panels; the shared pause menu is last. The guest's Ⓑ
  and START ride its own pointer/pad (`PadPointer.onCancel`).
- Stations: the personal-economy four (vendor, salvage bench, oracle stone,
  tracker's fire) scan ALL local human seats and attribute the dwell
  (`vendorDwellSeatId` …) — the panel opens for the seat that lingered, on
  its flank (witnessed live: the guest idled at the bench and got the bench).
  Town/meta stations (caravan, sail, hold, merc, borough, vocation) stay
  host-scoped.
- The positional veils (sight/room) are single-eye fabrics: under couch they
  SUSPEND per `COUCH_CFG.render` (each veil's own fade opens gracefully;
  engine LoS untouched); every local hero carries the lantern.

## Join, leave, persistence — THE LANE LAW

- The pause menu grows "Local Co-op — Player Joins" ONLY when main.ts wired
  the flow, ≥ `minPads` controllers are connected, and a guest seat is free
  (LocalTransport host only — never on a net client). Below the census the
  row still TEACHES, disabled: "press any button on a 2nd controller" — the
  browser's gamepad privacy gate hides a pad until its first press — and the
  census watcher (`couchTick` → `refreshEscapeCouchRow`) enables it LIVE the
  moment that press lands (the options subview is never yanked). The overlay
  (`ui/couchJoin.ts`, lobby idiom) runs "press Ⓐ on the JOINING controller"
  through `CouchClaimSession` (the claim pin above; exclusions = claimed
  slots + the pinned hero slot, frozen for the phase), then the pick.
- THE JOIN CEREMONY HOLDS: `couchJoinOpen` is a `'menu'`-kind timeflow
  surface (`TIME_CFG.surfaces['menu:couchJoin']`) — solo, the world freezes
  under the claim veil exactly like the pause menu (a live couch keeps
  running through the allowHold policy, same as the pause). The hero's hands
  leave play for the ceremony: `readLocalInput` nulls and `uiBlocking()`
  counts the overlay, so P1's pad drives the pointer over the veil, never a
  sword beneath it.
- MORTAL run → a fresh disposable hero (the net join's Tier-0 idiom; nothing
  persists). IMMORTAL run → another VESSEL from this account's roster —
  requires `immortalSlotsNeeded` (2) immortal slots unlocked
  (`feat_immortal_slot_2`) and a second sworn vessel; the join loads its
  slot, `rebuildSavedMeta` + `World.adoptSeatMeta` graft it onto the seat,
  `Seat.couchDeaths` seeds from its save.
- Persistence: `serializeCouchGuest` (build + carry + mode + own ring, NO
  world half — the ground belongs to the host's save; the dormant menagerie
  passes through verbatim) → `saveCouchGuest` into the vessel's own roster
  slot + index card. Rides every choke: autosave, `world.couchDirty`, menu
  exit, run end, the durable quit flush.
- THE GUEST COVENANT: a party wipe costs a guest vessel exactly what dying at
  home would — its own corpse (into `couchDeaths`, spawning when that vessel
  is next played), the whole carry strip, the stage advance — banked in
  `bankCouchWipe()` beside the host's own banking. Account-level writes
  (tithe, ledger merge, death tally) are NOT repeated: one account, one
  payment. The couch is never a cheaper way to die.
- Leave: the pause row, run end, or menu exit — vessel saved first, seat
  removed, pad freed, the frame narrows home on its own smoothing.

## Dials

Everything is `COUCH_CFG`: join (minPads, maxLocal, claimButton,
immortalSlotsNeeded, sides), camera (fitMarginWu, maxStretch, zoomLerp,
confineMarginWu), hud.sideInset, panels.sideWidthFrac, render veil policy.
A machine that wants keyboard-hero + one-pad-guest couch play turns
`minPads` to 1 — one dial, no code.

## Queued

Twin-instance core panels (both players in the SAME panel at once — the
clone lane the lens was shaped for); a per-seat guest binds override
(`Settings.padBinds` is shared today); guest possession HUD chips beyond the
cluster chip; the veil union pass ('union' beside 'off'/'p1'); net + couch
in one session (a couch guest beside remote peers — the seat fabric allows
it, the broadcast gate deliberately doesn't yet); in-run corpse spawning for
guest rings.
