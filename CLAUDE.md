# CLAUDE.md — Hollow Wake (ARPG)

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository. This file is committed and
shared with everyone who clones the repo.

## What this is
A top-down action RPG prototype in TypeScript + Vite, rendered on HTML5 Canvas
2D. Design thesis: every system is open, modular **data** — skills, monsters,
statuses, passives, zones are plain data entries composed by one shared engine,
and the player, monsters, and minions all act through a single skill pipeline
(`World.useSkill()` in `src/engine/world.ts`).

## Commands
- `npm install` — first-time setup (also run automatically by the .bat launchers).
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173 (browser dev mode, `Play Game.bat`).
- `npm run game` — the DESKTOP APP: Electron launcher window (shows installed
  version, checks the GitHub remote for updates, one-click pull → install →
  build) then the game in its own window. `Launch Game.bat` is the double-click
  wrapper; `npm run game:play` skips the launcher.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — fast type-check with no output. Primary correctness gate.
- `npm run check` — type-checks the game AND the launcher (`tsconfig.launcher.json`
  runs strict checkJs over `launcher/*.cjs`).
- `npm run build` — `tsc --noEmit && vite build` (type-check + production build to `dist/`).
- `npm run smoke` / `npm run smoke:launcher` — headless Electron self-checks:
  boot the real game window (or launcher), assert `__game` / start menu /
  `/__save` endpoint (or the IPC status round-trip), print `SMOKE … OK`, exit
  0/1. Run these after touching `launcher/` or anything boot-related.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built `dist/`.

No unit-test runner is configured; `tsc --noEmit` plus the smoke checks are how
we verify changes.

## Layout
- `src/engine/` — systems: `world.ts` (core loop, `useSkill`), `stats.ts`
  (layered modifier engine), `damage.ts`, `status.ts`, `skills.ts` (skill
  schema), `actor.ts` (one entity model for player/monsters/minions),
  `ai.ts` + `brain.ts` (composable enemy AI), `levelgen.ts`, `worldgen.ts`;
  items: `items.ts` (gear schema + every ITEM_CFG tunable), `itemgen.ts`
  (the one roller/compiler/describer), `inventory.ts` (tetris bag grid),
  `loot.ts` (nestable loot tables + DROP_CFG kill-path levers).
- `src/data/` — content as data: `skills.ts`, `supports.ts`, `monsters.ts`,
  `passives.ts`, `classes.ts`, `zones.ts`, `tilesets.ts`, `procs.ts`; items:
  `itembases.ts` (base families), `itemaffixes.ts` (the affix gamut via
  `fam()`), `uniques.ts`, `loottables.ts`. Adding content here needs no
  engine changes.
- `src/packages/` — optional per-run world-event overlays (Warbands, Breach,
  Contagion, …).
- `src/render/` — Canvas 2D renderer (placeholder geometry art driven by data).
- `src/ui/`, `src/net/`, `src/meta/` — DOM panels, co-op transport, and the
  account / save / permadeath meta-layer.
- `launcher/` — the Electron desktop shell (plain CJS, type-checked via
  `tsconfig.launcher.json`): `main.cjs` (windows, git update flow, build
  stamping, IPC, smoke modes), `server.cjs` (loopback HTTP server for `dist/`
  that re-implements the Vite disk-save `/__save/:slot` endpoints — SAME
  `saves/` folder as dev; keep the two implementations in sync), `preload.cjs`
  + `launcher.html` (the launcher UI). Tunables live in `launcher.config.json`
  (committed defaults) deep-merged with `launcher.config.local.json`
  (gitignored, machine-local) — never hardcode window/port/repo values.
- Entry point: `index.html` → `src/main.ts`.

Some data files are very large (`src/data/skills.ts`, `src/engine/world.ts`).
Prefer targeted `grep` over reading whole files.

## Commit convention
- After a meaningful change, run `npx tsc --noEmit` (or `npm run build`) and make
  sure it is clean **before** committing.
- Commit with a clear, imperative message saying what changed and why, e.g.
  `Add Frost Nova skill with cold-shatter threshold`.
- Keep commits focused — one logical change each where practical.
- Push when the user asks.
- Never commit generated or personal files: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `saves/`,
  and `.claude/settings.local.json` are gitignored on purpose. Machine-specific
  settings belong in `.claude/settings.local.json` (stays local, never pushed).
